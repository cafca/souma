# Souma


Souma is a distributed publishing and community platform, it allows communication and collaboration without the dangers and limitations of a centralized platform. By automatically coordinating group-forming processes it unleashes the Internetâ€™s power of bringing together users with shared interests without the overhead of conventional institutions. Souma reveals itself as a magazine-like, paged webapp and can be accessed from every modern webbrowser once the client has been installed.

Please see [this page](https://github.com/ciex/souma/wiki/Souma-App-Overview) in our Wiki for a more detailed description of what Souma does.
