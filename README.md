Souma
====

Souma is a peer to peer cognitive network, it allows communication and collaboration without the dangers and limitations of a centralized platform. By automatically coordinating group-forming processes it unleashes the Internet’s power of bringing together users with shared interests and intentions without the overhead of conventional institutions. Souma reveals itself as a magazine-like, paged website and can be accessed from every modern webbrowser once the client has been installed.

Development Status
====
Souma is currently in beta status. That means it should be expected to break and functionality is quite limited. Development is currently focussed on laying a groundwork in sensible protocols and APIs.
