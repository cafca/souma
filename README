Souma
=====

Souma is a peer to peer cognitive network, it allows communication and collaboration without the dangers and limitations of a centralized platform. By automatically coordinating group-forming processes it unleashes the Internetâ€™s power of bringing together users with shared interests and intentions without the overhead of conventional institutions. Souma reveals itself as a magazine-like, paged website and can be accessed from every modern webbrowser once the client has been installed.

Please see our Wiki for a more detailed description of what Souma does:
